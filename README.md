# Synthetic Data Generation using GANs with Self-Attention and Correlation Constraint

## Overview
This project aims to generate synthetic data that closely resembles real-world data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this implementation, we utilize a custom self-attention layer and introduce a correlation constraint to ensure that the generated data preserves the correlation structure of the real data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used for training the GAN. Include details such as the number of features, data format, and any preprocessing steps applied.

## Implementation Details
### Synthetic Data Generation
- **GAN Architecture**: Describe the architecture of the GAN model, including the generator, discriminator, and any custom layers used (e.g., self-attention).
- **Correlation Constraint**: Explain how the correlation constraint is incorporated into the GAN training process to preserve the correlation structure of the real data.

### Training
- **Data Splitting**: Explain how the real data is split into training and test sets.
- **Correlation Calculation**: Describe how the correlation coefficient is calculated from the training data.
- **GAN Training**: Detail the training procedure for the GAN model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and optimization techniques used.

### Evaluation
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explain how the correlation between the generated and real data is evaluated after training the GAN model.
- **Results**: Present the correlation coefficient between the real and synthetic data and discuss the performance of the model.
