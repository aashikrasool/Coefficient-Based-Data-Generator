# Attention Based Conditional GAN for Synthetic Crop Data: Solving Agricultureâ€™s Data Availability and Quality Challenges

## Overview
This project aims to generate synthetic data that closely resembles real-world data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this implementation, we utilize a custom self-attention layer and introduce a correlation constraint to ensure that the generated data preserves the correlation structure of the real data.


## Dataset
In this work we utilized crop production recomendation data which is publically available in Kaggle[1].

## Implementation Details
### Synthetic Data Generation
 **GAN Architecture**:
 
- ![Archictecture](https://github.com/aashikrasool/Coefficient-Based-Data-Generator/blob/main/GAN%20arch.png)
- Our framework introduces a multi-head attention layer within the generator. This innovation allows for a more nuanced discernment and emphasis on critical inter-feature relationships in tabular data, significantly improving the model's capability to capture and replicate complex data dynamics in the agricultural domain.



### Evaluation
- Though the labels 'pH' and 'Temperature' show almost 95% probability distribution, the number of each label is dramatically various. Moreover, it is the limitation of tabular GANs that they are not able to generate a specific amount of data. Nevertheless, our proposed approach performs better in producing evenly distributed data that closely resembles the original data in all columns with a likeness of 98%, except for the 'P' (Phosphorus) column, where the synthetic data shows a more rapid increase initially, suggesting a higher density of lower values compared to real data .
